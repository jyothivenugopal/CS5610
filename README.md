This project is developed by me for the Course, Web Development(CS 5610). The application's name is Search and Go! 
It makes use of Yelp API, Uber API and Google Geolocation API.
You can search for any activity in a location within your state(as Uber does not provide flight details) and the application will retrieve
the Price Estimates - how much each Uber vehicle will cost you to get to your destination,
the Time Estimates - how long it will take an Uber vehicle to get to your place based on Geolocation(or the vehicle closest to you),
and Promotions in case of a new user to get to your destination,
the distance to your destination from your place and many more statistics.

I have also provided a Wishlist Feature where users can add places they want to visit to a wishlist and later view them on the dashboard or delete items from a wishlist.
